 The sequence is defined as follows:

The first two numbers are 0 and 1.
Every subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.
This results in the well-known sequence:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

Understanding the Code

The code within this repository explores different approaches to calculate Fibonacci numbers. You'll find implementations in various programming languages, each demonstrating the core concepts and potential optimizations. Here are some common techniques you might encounter:

Recursive Approach: This straightforward method defines a function that calls itself with the two preceding numbers in the sequence until it reaches the base case (0 or 1). While intuitive, it can be computationally expensive for larger values of n due to repeated calculations.
Iterative Approach: This method utilizes a loop to iteratively calculate each Fibonacci number, storing the previous two values in variables. It's generally more efficient for larger n compared to the recursive approach.
Memoization: This technique involves storing previously computed Fibonacci numbers in a data structure (e.g., dictionary) to avoid redundant calculations. When a new number is requested, the code checks the memoization table first. If the value exists, it's retrieved directly; otherwise, it's calculated and added to the table for future reference. Memoization significantly improves performance for repeated calculations.
Matrix Exponentiation (Advanced): This advanced method leverages matrix multiplication to compute multiple Fibonacci numbers efficiently. It involves representing the Fibonacci recurrence as a matrix equation and repeatedly squaring the matrix to obtain the nth Fibonacci number. While more complex to understand, it can be exceptionally fast for very large n.
Choosing the Right Approach

The best method for your specific use case depends on several factors:

The desired range of n: If you only need a small number of Fibonacci numbers, the recursive approach might be sufficient. For larger n, the iterative or memoized approaches are preferred.
Performance requirements: If speed is critical, consider memoization or matrix exponentiation for very large n.
Code readability: The recursive approach is often considered the most intuitive, while the iterative approach might be clearer for some users.
